# **App Name**: Cryptic Decoder

## Core Features:

- Text to Morse: Convert text to Morse code using a dictionary-based mapping.
- Morse to Text: Convert Morse code (textual) to readable text using a dictionary-based mapping.
- Audio to Text: Analyze audio input to identify Morse code beeps and convert them into readable text using an AI model tool. The tool determines when the input is part of morse code.
- UI Interface: Provide a sleek, intuitive interface for inputting text, audio, or Morse code.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark grey (#333333) to give a mysterious and serious feel.
- Secondary color: Light grey (#A9A9A9) for contrast and readability.
- Accent: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for interactive elements.
- Clean and structured layout with clear sections for each functionality.
- Use simple, line-based icons related to cryptography and espionage.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting.

## Original User Request:
I want to create an application with beautiful ui , the theme should be spy related , it should have features to convert morse code into text and vica versa and also from morse audio into text , something more for details you can make it by yourself also 1. Textual Morse Code (e.g., ... --- ...)
You don’t need an AI model—a simple mapping/dictionary-based approach is more efficient.

Tools:

Python or JavaScript

Use a dictionary to map Morse to letters

No AI needed here.

2. Audio Morse Code (beeps)
Now you can bring in AI to detect patterns.

Workflow:

Convert audio to spectrogram or MFCC features

Train a model to detect dots, dashes, and pauses

Decode the sequence using rules

AI Tools:

Librosa or pydub (for audio processing)

TensorFlow or PyTorch (for ML model)

CNN or LSTM model to detect patterns from audio features

3. Visual Morse Code (e.g., blinking lights or flashing patterns)
Here, computer vision can help recognize dot-dash patterns.

AI Tools:

OpenCV for image/video processing

YOLOv5 or custom CNN for identifying light states (on = signal, off = pause)

RNN or LSTM to sequence the flashes into Morse symbols
